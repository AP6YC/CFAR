# `scripts`

## Description

This folder contains the experiments of the `CFAR` project as an enumerate series of folders.
Each folder contains a set of scripts implementing the experiment, some requiring running the scripts themselves in enumerated order or in various programming languages.
Each experiment folder contains a `README.md` summarizing the purpose of each script and how to run them.

## Experiments

The experiments in this folder are summarized as follows:

- `0_init/`: a set of experiments for developing library code in other experiments or demonstrating low-level usage of some utilities.
- `1_gaussian/`: a set of multivariate Gaussian-distributed samples are generated, and one of them is moved around to demonstrate training/testing performance change in various models as the samples start to overlap.
- `2_benchmarks/`: training and testing of ART machine learning modules on benchmark datasets in condensed lifelong learning scenarios to generate L2 metrics.
